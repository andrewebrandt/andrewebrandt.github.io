**Research Summary**

**Background**: The [National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reading?grade=12) assesses student performance in reading in both public and private schools across the US. The assessment measures reading comprehension by asking students to read selected grade-appropriate materials and answer questions based on what they have read. The NAEP reading scale scores range from 0 to 500. In the most recent reading assessment (2019), approximately 26,700 grade 12 students were tested, and their scores serve as the best estimate of reading performance in the 12th grade population, mu = 285. 

The York Prep Academy, a top-ranked private school in a large metropolitan city of the eastern US, has recently posted its 2019 NAEP reading assessment results collected from n = 38 12th graders: mean = 309, SD = 30. This school has a tuition cost of $55,000 a year, and claims that its students' exceptionally high test scores justify the cost.

**Hypothesis**: YPA 12th graders perform significantly better than the national average on the NAEP reading assessment.


### 1. Sample summary

Use the describe() function in the *psych* package to create a descriptive statistics summary table for the sample NAEP scores in read.df.
```{r}
library(psych)


```


### 2. Plot the frequency distribution

Use ggplot() in the *ggplot2* package to plot the reading scores in a frequency distribution graph (histogram). Set bins = 50.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

                    
```


### 3. NHST using a one-sample t-test

Test the null hypothesis that the average NAEP score from the York Prep Academy is no different than average NAEP score in the general population, mu = 285. Use a two-tail test and assume alpha = .05.

Use t.test() to run the one-sample t-test on reading scores and generate a p-value. Show the results.
```{r}

  
```
