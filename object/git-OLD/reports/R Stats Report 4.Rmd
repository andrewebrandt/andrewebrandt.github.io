**Research Summary**

*Background*: "Major depressive disorder in adolescence is common...and a major risk factor for depression, suicide, and social impairment in adulthood. Response rates for CBT and medication in previous studies are approximately 60%, leaving substantial room for improvement in treatment outcomes. In adults, the combination of CBT with medication may lead to greater improvement in depression than monotherapy with either treatment. Although combined treatment is frequently recommended by experts, especially for more severely ill patients, the relative efficacy of CBT and medication, alone and in combination, for depressed adolescents is unknown" (See March et al., 2004, ps. 807 - 808).

*Hypothesis*: Combined CBT-fluoxetine treatment will result in less severe depressive symptoms compared to placebo or either treatment alone.

*Design and Procedure*: Adolescent patients 12 - 17 years old who met criteria for major depressive disorder were recruited for a 12-week clinical trial through clinics and public advertisement. Patients and at least one parent provided informed consent. Participants were randomly assigned to one condition: placebo, fluoxetine alone, CBT alone, or combined CBT and fluoxetine. Participants completed several outcome measures, including the Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS) at three times; prior to treatment (pretest), halfway through treatment, and after completing treatment (posttest) (higher scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms).


### 1. Summary data table

Use the describeBy() function in the *psych* package to create a descriptive summary table for posttest scores (DepPost.Y) across the four treatment conditions (Cond.X). 
```{r}
library(psych) 


```


### 2. Bar graph

Use the ggplot() and geom_col() functions in the *ggplot2* package to create a bar graph for the means and standard errors of the posttest scores by treatment condition.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

                  
```


### 3. F-statistic

Use the aov() function to run an independent-samples ANOVA on depression posttest scores. Use the summary() function to show the ANOVA source table.
```{r}


```


### 4. Tukey's tests

Use the tukey_hsd() function in the *rstatix* package to run Tukey's tests on all pairwise comparisons.
```{r}
library(rstatix)


```
