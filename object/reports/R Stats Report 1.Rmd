**Research Summary**

Students enrolled in an introductory psychology course completed an online survey. Participants answered items about their gender identity, phone screen time, sadness, feelings about the future, and sleep quality (see all items in Appendix A).


### 1. Scatter plot

Use ggplot() in the *ggplot2* package to create a scatter plot of the relationship between sadness (X) and feelings about the future (Y).
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

                    
```


### 2. Descriptive statistics summary table

Use select() in the *dplyr* package to select the ScreenT and SleepQual variables and use the describe() function in the *psych* package to create a descriptive statistics summary table.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(psych)

   
```
