**Research Summary**

Students enrolled in an introductory psychology course completed an online survey. Participants reported their gender identity, phone screen time, sadness, feeling discouraged about the future, sleep quality, and self compassion (3 items) (see all items in Appendix A). 


### 1. Scatter plot

In the pairs panel created in the last assignment, we saw that sadness (Y) scores were most strongly correlated with feeling discouraged about the future (r = 0.73), mean self-compassion (r = -0.22), and sleep quality (r = -0.15).

Use ggplot() in the *ggplot2* package to create a scatter plot of the strongest relationship, between Future (X) and Sad (Y). Be sure to add appropriate X and Y axis labels. 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(selfComp.df, aes(x = Future, y = Sad)) +          # data frame, aesthetic
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(0.1), na.rm = TRUE,   # plot points
             size = 3, color = "darkblue", alpha = 0.5) +     # size, color, and transparency of points
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y ~ x", se = TRUE, na.rm = TRUE) +  # plot line and se
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Long Time Without Phone") +      # x axis label
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Life Satisfaction") +            # y axis label
  theme_minimal() +                                           # visual format
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16))                       # text size
 
```                


### 2. Strip chart

Use ggplot() in the *ggplot2* package to create a strip chart between Gender (X) and Sad (Y). Be sure to add appropriate X and Y axis labels. In the scale_x_discrete() command, you may remove limits = c() to show scores in all gender categories. 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

       
```                


### 3. Analysis of regression

Use lm() to create a new regression model for the Sad (Y) scores called **model.sad**. Use Future (X), SCmean (X), and SleepQual (X) as predictor variables. Use summary() to show the results. 
```{r}


```


### 4. Variance inflation factors

Use vif() in the *car* package to check for redundant predictor variables in the model.
```{r}
library(car)


```
