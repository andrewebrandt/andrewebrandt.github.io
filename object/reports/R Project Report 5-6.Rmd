**Research Summary**

Students enrolled in an introductory psychology course completed an online survey. Participants reported their gender identity, phone screen time, sadness, feeling discouraged about the future, sleep quality, and self compassion (3 items) (see all items in Appendix A). 

<br>

In the previous report, you tested a multiple linear regression model for sadness with three predictor variables; feelings about the future, self compassion, and sleep quality. After running the first code chunk above, you should see the results of this test in the console.

    model.sad <- lm(formula = Sad ~ Future + SCmean + SleepQual, data = selfComp.df)
    summary(model.sad)

Only feelings about the future predicted participants' sadness, despite the fact that both self compassion and sleep quality have predicted self-reported sadness in previous studies. It is possible that one or both of these factors does predict sadness, but only when other conditions are met. In this assignment, we explore the interaction between gender and self compassion (note, levels of Gender with fewer than 10 scores have been removed from that factor).


### 1. Mean center the quantitative predictor variables

Use the mutate() function in *dplyr* package to mean center the mean Self Compassion scores (SCmean).
```{r}
library(dplyr)


```


### 2. Build a moderation model

Use the lm() function to build a moderation model of sadness (Sad) to test the individual effects of 1) Gender and 2) Self Compassion as well as the 3) Gender x Self Compassion interaction (your results should include a test for each of these three effects). Be sure to only use mean centered Self Compassion scores.
```{r}


```


### 3. Variance inflation factors

Use vif() in the *car* package to check for redundant predictor variables in the model.
```{r}
library(car)


```


### 4. Plot the interaction

Us the ggplot() function in the *ggplot2* package to plot the relationship between Sadness and Self Compassion (mean centered) across male and female participants. 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)                                                  


```


### 5. Simple slopes analysis

Use the lm() function to test the male and female simple slopes between Sadness and Self Compassion.
```{r}


```
