**Research Summary**

Students enrolled in an introductory psychology course completed an online survey. Participants reported their gender identity, phone screen time, sadness, feeling discouraged about the future, sleep quality, and self compassion (3 items) (see all items in Appendix A).


### 1. Calculate a scale score

Use mutate() in the *dplyr* package to create a new variable called **SCmean** for the mean score of the three self compassion items. Use the head() function to show the first 5 scores in the new variable. 
```{r}
library(dplyr)


```                


### 2. Pairs panels

Use select() in the *dplyr* package to select the screenT, Sad, Future, SleepQual, and SCmean variables and use the pairs.panels() function in the *psych* package to examine the relationship between each pair.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(psych)


```
