### 1. Calculate a value

Enter the console commands that are required to find "s" in the following formula:

$s = \sqrt{\frac{1634}{92}}$

```{r}


```


### 2. Load a package and execute a command

The "datasets" package contains several data sets, including one called women, which contains 15 observations on two variables, height and weight. In the code chunk below,  

  1. Use library() to load the "psych" and "datasets" packages (be sure both are installed first)
  2. Use describe() to find the descriptive statistics for the two variables
  3. Use plot() to create a plot with the two variables
  
```{r}
library(psych)
library(datasets)


```
